# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Ridwan.

I'm a **Python engineer** and **systematic discretionary trader** focused on data-driven systems, market structure, and decision architecture.  
I design tools that merge research, technology, and strategy — from trading frameworks to analytical platforms.

### 🧩 Current Work
- **MetaQuant** — research and analytics engine for trading systems  
- **MetaMacro** — internal global macro framework (hybrid discretionary + systematic)  
- **Quantitative Strategy Design** — modeling price behavior, volatility structure, and execution logic  
- **Automation & Data Infrastructure** — Python-based tools for research, data processing, and production systems
